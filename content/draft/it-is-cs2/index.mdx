*While I planned on weighing out each major in depth, I quickly realized that I wouldn't be able to give an accurate and unbiased opinion without any first-hand experience. However,*

The thought going through everyone's minds at the moment is, **what major should I choose?**

If you are unsure on what to pick, rest assured that every major is in demand, and have their own strengths. However, keep in mind that each major have their own challenges, and none are not easier than the others.


But how should you go about choosing your major? 


# Background
The easiest way of choosing one of the majors could be based on your background with that particular major. You may have had some experience in the past which peaked your interest in a certain area, or have some sort of goals related to a major. 

However, if you have no background in any of these majors, here are some descriptions of the majors, alongide quotes from FCIT20 students on why they have chosen their major.

## Information Systems
Information Systems is a confusing major to understand, as there is no single word that can describe it. IS graduates meet both technical and business needs, are good at analyzing big data, and recomending business decisions based on that data.

## Information Technology
IT students deal with infrastructure, such as Databases and Networks.

	{"CS and IT are almost the same but still there is some differences between them. However, I don't want to study math at all, or anything close to it. I found that IT is better than CS in the hardware side. However, all FCIT majors focus on software the most."}

	{"I entered IT because the IT world is practical! Everything I study there is important, unlike other majors, where you will study something  that won't help that much. My goal is to be professional at network security."}

In the end, **the best major to pick is the one that you enjoy the most, and fits your background, skills, and goals**. As such, you would naturally be motivated to do your best, and excel at what you do.

While many students group together based on major, this is a waste of an opportunity! As time goes on, we specialize further into our majors, gaining new skills along the way. **Instead of arguing on which major is best, we should instead take advantage of our diverse talents and work with, not against together.**
