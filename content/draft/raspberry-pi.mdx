My Raspberry Pi has played a major role into developing the skills, from Linux to Networking.

One of my iginal goals was to integrate my software with hardware, and one of the main reasons I learnt JavaScript was due to it's unique ability to quickly create both backend servers and frontend UIs.

# Why not Arduino?

While an Arduino may have been a better choice for embedded systems, I felt like a Raspberry Pi was a far better option for me a beginner. An Arduino is a microcontroller, used to control circuits. However, it has no Operating System, and does not come with Bluetooth or WIFI by default. In contrast, the Rasbperry Pi can be used as a normal computer, with some caveats*.

However, this does come with a few drawbacks:
- Slower I/O Speed
- Fewer GPIO pins
- More Expensive

I think that it is a great way to explore new things, but the hardest part for me was setting it up.

# Buying the things you need

I bought a Raspberry Pi 4B, along with a kit full of misellanious electronic parts.

However, if you have an idea in mind, make sure to plan ahead and get all the parts needed in advance, as it takes a long time to ship individual parts.

Furthermore, parts tend to be quite expensive, so I would reccoemnd getting a kit such as the one I got to ensure you have everything needed.

The power supply is crucial, as if you do not have a strong enough power supply, you

# The Operating System

When I had started out with my Raspberry Pi, the main Operating System used was Raspbian, which is similar to Debian. Rasbbian is lightweight and custom made for the rasbperry pi, 

The Raspberry Pi has an ARM chip, most Operating Sysetms do not work with the Raspberry Pi.
