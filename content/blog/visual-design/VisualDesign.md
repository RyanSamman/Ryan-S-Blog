**An eye for Visual Design is a crucial skill in our modern world.** In this day and age, to reach the top of your game, there is steep competition.

But how would you be able to stand out, you ask? **By employing effective Visual Design techniques!**

While technical skills and knowledge are important, humans are inherently visual, and we form our initial opinions based on visual aspects before anything else. Visual design also plays a large role in creating a brand image for yourself and/or your company, through it's extensive use cases. From websites and games, to logos and CVs, Visual Design is applicable everywhere.

## EVALUATION OF THE SLIDES

While I was thinking about the design of the course's slides, I remembered this talk from MIT on Public Speaking:

<div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;">
<iframe  style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Unzc731iCUY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>


In the talk, the presenter briefly spoke about the use of slides, and how slides should be structured to grasp the attention of the audience. Or rather yet, **for slides to NOT grasp the attention of the audience.** To clarify my point, I did a case study of an extremely successful Computer Science course, [Harvard's CS50x](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science) [[alt](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/)].

Looking through [CS50x's Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KMzq3bLe7g_O4JVYZ0lxuxHjShnIk54beO84-chYTig/edit), the results are shocking:

There is barely anything on the slides! As you can see, they haven't just minimized the clutter, but have eliminated it entirely! **The only thing on each slide is a visualization of a concept that the presenter wants the audience to be learning at that point in time.**


Compared to a Slide from CPIT221:

Spot the difference? Although there may be more content on CPIT221's slides, to read the slides while the lecture is midway causes you to lose focus on the professor. Furthermore, the visual elements are definitely great, but it distracts the audience from both the text and the professor!

In this case, a more appropriate slide would be simply **showing** what whitespace is, and in the process, why it is important:

</center>

Just from a quick glance at the picture, you can immediately understand what would otherwise take paragraphs to describe.

Of course, there are significantly more good slides than bad, and the other 100 journals will reflect that. However, I hope my insights would be beneficial down the line.




## CONCLUSION

While I do think there should be a document containing information students need to know, I don't think the slides are the ideal place to put those details.

Furthermore, the context which the slides are in matters. If the topic being presented is more information heavy, I would simply move away from slides, and use a white board, touch screen, or any other relevant medium. This is so the audience isn't overwhelmed with information, and is able to take in the information at a slower pace than flipping through slides.

While I do think the slides themselves have flaws, I don't think they have much of an effect on CPIT221 as a whole. I tend to focus more on the professor instead of the slides, visualizing the points in my head as if I were reading a book. Regardless of my criticism of the slides, **I do believe that CPIT221 is the best course from KAU that I've taken so far.** The project-based learning is much more enjoyable and memorable than simply studying for an exam, and I think more courses such as CPCS202 should employ this method.
